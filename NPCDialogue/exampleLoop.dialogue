Hey i need your help.
{0.1} //
Can you do this thing for me?
{1.1} //yes
Great!
{1.1loop} //where the loop starts
These are the directions to this place.
Come back to me when you do it!
{loop="1.1Loop":flag="thing to do"} //This will loop from 0 when reactivated and will only continue when flag is true
{2}
Woah! you did the thing!
{loop=2:flag=false} //loops forever
{1.2} //no
Aww thats a shame.
